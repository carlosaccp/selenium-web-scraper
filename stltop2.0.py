# Created by carlosaccp all rights reserved. The following code was written in MacOS Catalina 10.15.16

# The aim of this program is to scrape designer data from STLTop and store it in an sqlite file so it can be uploaded to Metabase
# THIS PROGRAM IS MEANT TO BE RAN EVERY 24 HOURS, IF NOT THE DATA GATHERED IS USELESS!

# What you need:
# Packages: Selenium, time, scipy, math, datetime, pandas, sqlite3, sqlalchemy
# Software: A chromium chromedriver called 'chromedriver'

# Importing all of the necessary packages for the webscraper, make sure all of them are installed

import selenium
import time
import scipy as sp
import math
import datetime
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from datetime import datetime
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

# Create a date variable and set it to today's date and time
date = datetime.date(datetime.now())

# Define the options for when the chromedriver opens
# Note these options are made for Windows users, they do not work on (at least my) MacOs syste,
chrome_options = Options()
chrome_options.add_argument("no-sandbox")
chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-extensions")
chrome_options.add_argument("--headless")
chrome_options.add_argument("window-size=1680,1050")

# Tell Python to locate the Webdriver, as well as the options we want it to run. In my case, I had it in the same folder as the code so this is enough
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=r"/usr/bin/chromedriver ", options=chrome_options)
# Open the website we want to scrape. I wanted to scrape www.stltop.com/
driver.get("https://www.stltop.com/")

# Things start to become specific to www.stltop.com, and may change a considerable amount when scraping other websites
# For context, I am interested in scraping all of the designers listed in STLTop's names and patron numbers, and there are 6 designers lister per page

# My preferred way of location elements is to locate them by XPath, but there are many other ways to do it such as locating it by id, name, tag name...

# Create a variable and define it so when its ran it closes the 'allow cookies' window. 
fuckcookies = driver.find_element_by_xpath(r"/html/body/div/div/div/div/div[2]/div[2]/button").click()
# Count the number of elements I want to scrape. I did this by finding the total number of Patrons listed on STLTop (Which came as 'xxx PATRONS'
# and then stripping ' PATRONS' from the string
elements = int(driver.find_element_by_xpath(r"/html/body/section[2]/div/div[1]/div/div/a").text.strip(' PATREONS'))
# Create an empty array to which I will append another array consisting of a designer's name and patron number
patronlist = []
# Create a pgcounter variable which will be useful later on to count how many pages we have cycled through
pgcounter = 1

#Create a for loop that loops from when number == 1 to when number == elements
for number in range (1 , elements+1):
    # Redefine the counter variable as number % 6. This means that we will know what element of a page the program is scraping as there are 6 elements per page.
    counter = number % 6
    # If counter != 0 <==> if the last element of the page hasn't been reached and pgcounter != math.floor(elements/6+1) <==> we are not on the last page, so
    # we need to scrape 6 times, not any less as on the last page there is a 5/6 chance that there are < 6 elements, so we need to find a way to find how many
    # elements are on the last page to only scrape said elements, not more as that leads to error
    if (counter != 0) and pgcounter != math.floor(elements/6 + 1):
            # Locate the name by xpath and store it in a variable. Note that I have formatted the XPath; this is because the XPath is correlated to the element
